Dr. Maloney is a Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin ([TCD](www.tcd.ie)) and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies ([DIAS](www.dias.ie)). He obtained his PhD from TCD studying solar physics in 2012. He worked as a lead software engineer at an SME from 2012 until 2016. Shane moved back into academia in late 2016, rejoining the solar and space weather group, working on [STIX](https://stix.i4ds.net) a next generation X-ray instrument on [Solar Orbiter](http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/) which is due for launch in Feb 2020.

<!-- Dr Maloney obtained his PhD in solar physics from Trinity College Dublin focusing on large eruptions from the Sun or coronal mass ejections (CME) and their propagation through Heliosphere. After his PhD he was recruited by an SME initially as software developer before taking on a role as a lead software engineer. After his time in industry he returned to solar physics bringing import software engineering skills into academia.

Shane’s research interests lie in studying the most powerful solar events, flares and CMEs, what triggers them and how they can ultimately effect society as space weather. As society becomes more technologically reliant the ability to accurately predict or forecast adverse space weather also increases. By better understanding what trigger solar events and how they propagate adverse space weather forecasts can be improved. 

Currently Shane is a Research Fellow at DIAS and Trinity College Dublin working on the next generation of solar X-ray instruments STIX due for launch on SolarOrbiter in 2020. He is a strong advocate of truly open source and reproducible science, “software is the most used scientific instrument" -->
